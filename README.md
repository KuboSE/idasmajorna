# idasmajorna
A repository for an idea of a game I'm making. I'll work on it procedurally.

## The name basis 
This is really a blend of ideas - the *IDAS* (in-depth affection system) I have laid out for the future, and *Majorna*, the combination of Majora and Minora, from the name *Major/Minor*, a visual novel that somehow made it to the Steam market - that I have and probably will do something with. It was supposed to be a joke, but I have decided to do more with it than just let it sit around.  

## What is there yet, as of December 4th, 2016?
Good question. This markdown file counts, I believe.
